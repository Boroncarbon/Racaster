# Racaster
A simple raycaster built in Processing

For this project, I wanted to get a feel for the simplest method of rendering 3D graphics there is: Raycasting.
The concept behind raycasting is so simple that after watching a short Youtube video describing it I closed the tab and decided that I would recreate it for myself from memory.

I chose to code my raycaster in Processing as I was familiar with it from Daniel Schiffman's wonderful Youtube channel The Coding Train, and it gave me the ability to manually set the RGB value of each pixel in the canvas. This was important to me: I wanted no pre-baked functionality other than this.
